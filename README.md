# IEOR_Lunch_and_Learn
This repository contains slides and ipython notebooks covered in Berkeley's IEOR Graduate Student Lunch and Learn Sessions.
The purpose of the repository is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge/techniques/ideas and communications among IEOR graduate students. The repository is under constant construction and we welcome both feedback and contributions. 
The basic structure of the repo is as follows:
  1. All lunch-and-learn materials will be posted by week/session under Lunch-and-Learn (folder). 
  2. Research related material may be found under the Research (folder)
  3. Industry Career related material may be found under Industry/Internship (folder). 

Please feel free to add additional resources and ideas to existing documents or add new components as you see fit. Please be concise and clear in presenting your work to facilitate the process. 

Enjoy,
IEOR Graduate Student Group (Cheng, Kevin, Quico)
